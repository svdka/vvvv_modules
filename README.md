<H3>360 degree snapshot + Module_write360</H3>
Some very primitive module to export a 3d mesh into jpg snapshots from different angles
Could be mucher cleaner, this thing just writes until you stop in, no counting feedback on files & so on,
but it does what I needed it for. 

<H3>module_aligntonormals</H3>
Everything is in the title, with resampling 
everything on CPU not very efficient :) 

<H3>module_beatcam</H3>
Some old camera module to animate on beat 

<H3>module_dynatex</H3>
creates a dynamictexture with input (usually fft)
